## Bookshelves Project Summary

## During the project, I got a better grasp at React. I still lack skills in React but the project helped for it. It was better learning this way, because I was able to focus on the lesson and try to implement it into the project. During this project, I also found some useful infomation on promises, react, and functions.

##There are alot of things that I need to improve on. During the project, I would attempt to work on the functions but Fah would have it done in like a hour or two. Which would of taken me 4x the amount times she took to figure it out. Faster functionality thinking. I'm guessing I need to work on everything, I understand most of everything but working on the advance part would take me quite awhile to finish.
